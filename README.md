## Neighborhood Map: Rome Italy (center)

Link to the application: [http://alessandroluciani.github.io/p5/](http://alessandroluciani.github.io/p5/)

This application is a map of Rome that displays 20 popular 'museum' in the area.  It utilizes the Wikipedia API to get the page associated to these locations.  The pages can be viewed by clicking the link inside the infoHTML.

There is a search bar that can be used to filter the results by either name or type.  Locations can be selected by clicking on the result in the list view or by clicking on a marker on the map.  Selecting a location will cause an infowindow (containing additional information about the place plus google API link) to display above the map marker.
